1. SCAN SETUP

   * A scan was initiated using Tenable Nessus Essentials.
   * The target host for the scan was 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
   * The scan configuration included default settings to detect vulnerabilities and gather system information.

2. SCAN EXECUTION

   * Nessus scanned the target for:

     * Known vulnerabilities
     * Weak configurations
     * Exposed services
   * After completion, results were reviewed within the Nessus web interface.

3. EXPORT RESULTS

   * Scan results were exported in .nessus format (default).
   * The .nessus file is an XML-based structure containing all scan findings.
   * A summary was extracted manually for use in a human-readable report.

4. REPORT GENERATION

   * A structured report was created in DOCX format including:

     * Summary of vulnerabilities with severity breakdown
     * Suggested remediations for key findings
     * Highlighted critical/medium severity vulnerabilities
     * Placeholder section for inserting screenshots of the scan interface

5. FINALIZATION

   * The PDF report was saved and made available for download.
   * This README documents the scanning and reporting workflow for future reference.
